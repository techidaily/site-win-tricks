### **Check for the Malware**

As we have discussed, there might be a malware that may have changed the settings of the Windows Defender and hence causing this trouble. So it is essential to catch and remove that malware to resolve the problem. You must use a proper antimalware for removing that. Here MalwareFox is used for the purpose.

![MalwareFox Antimalware](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/malwarefox.png)

Perform the full system scan, and after the process is complete, restart the computer. Now check if Windows Defender is running correctly or not. If not, then you should disable the other antimalware program and keep only Windows Defender active.

## Bottom Line

To summarize, in this guide, we have discussed what the possible causes and solutions for the error message “Your Virus and Threat Protection Is Managed by Your Organization” are. Although if you are still facing the problem, you can try any other antimalware and disable the Windows Defender.
