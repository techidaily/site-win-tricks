Windows Defender is the inbuilt security solution of Windows. Though previously, it used to be heavily criticized because of its low effectiveness, from the past few years, Microsoft has improved a lot in it, and today it is one of the top security programs available.

> “Your Virus and Threat Protection Is Managed by Your Organization”

Some users reported that they are receiving this error message while they try to open or start scanning in the Windows Defender.
