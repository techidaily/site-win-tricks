## Top 8 Secure Browser Add-Ons: Enhance Safety with Chrome Protectors Like MalwareFox

However, it is also clear that Chrome is not a privacy-friendly browser. Most users have severe **privacy and security** concerns while using it.

Along with being a browser, Chrome is also a data collecting tool for its parent company Google. Google, the biggest marketing company in the world, uses Chrome’s data for targeted ads. 

Apart from Google, many other websites also take advantage of Chrome’s poor privacy with [malware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/), [spyware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/), and browser-trackers constantly invading the browser.

Ironically, if Chrome is responsible for these problems, it is also the source of the solutions. Chrome has its own [web extension store](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) that has millions of add-ons to heighten your browsing. Fortunately, you can benefit from multiple Chrome extensions to defend your privacy.

Here are the best Chrome Security Extensions that would enhance your browsing experience and make it more secure and private.

Adblock Plus is an excellent tool for blocking irritating ads while you browse the internet. After installing it, whenever you visit any website, it will automatically [block the ads](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) in the background and make your browsing experience better.

Usually, people must support legitimate sites such as informative blog sites by letting them display ads because ads are the primary source of their earnings. For that, Adblock Plus has the option to allow advertisements on the websites you chose to.

![Blur](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blur.png)

Blur is a must-have web extension for Chrome users. It fulfills multiple requirements for you. The first one is a [password management](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) extension.

The HTTPS Everywhere works precisely as its name. It ensures that the websites you visit are protected with HTTPS instead of just HTTP. HTTPS assures that the website is encrypting the login credentials and other details you share with the sites.

Although Google Chrome has announced that they would only allow the websites with HTTPS for privacy safety, millions of sites are still running with HTTP. Therefore, HTTPS Everywhere extension is essential to have.

![DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DuckDuckGo.png)

Many of you might have heard of DuckDuckGo as the privacy-concerned search engine, the [best alternative to Google’s](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) data collecting search engine. However, along with the search engine, DuckDuckGo also provides a privacy-focused web extension. Apart from providing privacy features such as blocking the trackers and ensuring the HTTPS visits, DuckDuckGo also grades the sites you visit. Websites are ranked A-F with A being most secured and F the least one.

## [Privacy Badger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacy-badger/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp)

![Privacy Badger](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Privacy-Badger.png)

Many security extensions use pre-defined filters to block the trackers, but they often failed because they are not updated with the latest interfering techniques used by hackers. Privacy Badger brilliantly handles this disadvantage. By sending the “**Do Not Track**” signals, it automatically decides on which site to block. Moreover, the developers regularly update the site to keep up with the latest signatures.

Browser addons must be used only, as a first line of defence against internet threats. You can find some noteworthy on chrome store and others that just are useless. Use 3 or 4 webfilters, test them and keep only one that suites you the most. Personally I use “Safe Web”, because is reliable, has versions for all major browsers (chrome, firefox, edge) and it gets update regurarly. It can filter up to 28 website categories (including malicious, phishing, scam, spam, porn, adult, gambling, social networking and others).I am using it also for parental controling purposes.
