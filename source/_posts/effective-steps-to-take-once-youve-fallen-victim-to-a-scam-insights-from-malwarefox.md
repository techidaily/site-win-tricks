<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Tech Support scams come in different forms. The oldest way is a call pretending to be a representative from a reputable company. They may offer their services or ask you to download fake updates.

More recent efforts are much harder to identify. Some pop-ups and malware would issue fake warnings and ask you to download software. These pop-ups may even look like legitimate warning prompts from Windows. Others would lure you with contact information.

The technical support representative will then ask for payment through different methods. Walmart and iTunes Cards are popular requests. These methods are virtually impossible to trace.
