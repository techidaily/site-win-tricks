### What is Markdown file?

Basically, this method is used to easily read and write plain text and at the same time, it is a conversion tool.

Converting Markdown to PDF files is a great way to bring your Markdown files like documents or if you want a different output method other than HTML. In this case, listed below are tools you can use to convert your Markdown files to PDF.
