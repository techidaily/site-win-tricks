## What is Stalkerware?

Stalkerware or [Spyware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) is a general term used to describe an application that is specifically designed to track all or specific activities on your devices. This malware uses the GPS in your device to track your location. This software can be installed on smartphones, tablets, laptops, and even desktop PCs, without your consent or knowledge and remain hidden in the device. 

In some cases, Stalkerware also takes complete control over the victim’s devices by spying on them through its camera and recording any audio conversations taking place around it.

Stalkerware is mostly developed for mobile devices; however, you might find many such programs for Windows and macOS too. 

## Who uses Stalkerware Apps?

Here is the list of people who commonly install Stalkerware:

* **Spouse or partner** who can’t accept the end of a relationship, who wants to know your every move, and one who is desperate enough to hire someone to do all this for them.
* **Parents who are suspicious** about their children’s activities online. They want to[track their kids](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) without revealing that they are spying on them.
* **The employer who wants to track** his/her employees’ activities and ensure the productivity of the workforce.
* **Law enforcement agencies** such as the FBI, CIA, and NSA can use it for monitoring threats from other countries or criminal activities occurring inside a country. They might also use it to spy on their citizens to keep a check on any potential threats before they arise.
* **Hostile governments** that want to keep an eye on political dissidents, journalists, activists, etc., in their own country or those who have fled from fear of persecution and are residing in another country as refugees. They might be using Stalkerware or spyware apps for tracking phones belonging to these people without getting caught by foreign governments or agencies.

## How does Stalkerware App work?

The most basic way in which Stalkerware can infiltrate your devices is by tricking you into downloading and installing them. Once the installation of this application is complete, you won’t be able to find out whether it has installed itself on your phone or not. Also, since the developers of this software are using advanced algorithms that are specifically designed for spying purposes, it might not get detected by antivirus applications or anti-malware.

On the other hand, if there is physical access to your device then all a hacker needs to do is install an infected SIM card on their own phone and enter some specific commands on their own phone to get spy features on your smartphone without alerting you.

## How does Stalkerware affect your privacy?

If you think that you will never get attacked by such an application, then let us tell you that such applications are spreading like wildfire throughout the world. There has been a rapid increase in malware threats against mobile phones in the past few years. Malware developers are disrupting the security of our mobile phones by developing highly advanced spyware like Stalkerware to disrupt our privacy.

Stalkerware apps can track your location, record all conversations you make on your phone, access personal photos and videos, read your messages (SMS & WhatsApp), [capture keystrokes](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/), collect passwords for websites or bank accounts, etc., to name a few. These activities will take place without you even knowing about them.

The worst part is that Stalker has no limits; once this application is installed on your device, there is no stopping it from sending private data over the internet. Your information might be used in ways that you cannot even think of. You might not know what use they might put your data to. It might be used for commercial purposes, or they can pass it on to another person who will then use it for illegal activities such as identity theft, etc.

It is also possible that hackers could access your private images and videos and start blackmailing you with them online. This application has the potential to ruin your life.

## How does Stalkerware enter your device?

A Stalkerware program can infiltrate your device like any other malware. Here are the most common ways:

1\. Downloading free third-party apps infected with malicious stalking codes.

2\. Clicking on any phishing links available online or opening an email that has a malicious file attached. 

3\. Using cracked versions of paid mobile applications without knowing that these were created using leaked source codes.

4\. Installing unauthorized software/applications from third-party sources other than Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

5\. Opening attachments in spam emails sent by hackers under the name of banks, credit card agencies, etc., offering large sums of money or just to wish you luck for winning the lottery. These attachments might contain computer programs designed purely for spying purposes to access your device without leaving any evidence behind

6\. Accessing torrent websites using unsecured public Wi-Fi connections or hotspots without using any virtual private network (VPN) server.
