## Ultimate Guide: Streaming Spotify Tracks with VLC Media Player

### Overview

* I often enjoy Spotify music online, but now I want to play some Spotify music in my VLC player, but I do not know how to do this. One of my friend told me that I need to download the Spotify music files, but I failed to use my previous music downloader to download the Spotify music files. So can you introduce me a workable Spotify music downloader to download the Spotify music to VLC player supported music formats?

Spotify is a popular music streaming service on which users can enjoy millions of music songs. VLC is a free media player and users can use it to play many kinds of video and audio files, like MP4, AVI, MP3, AAC, etc, but VLC can not directly play Spotify music and users need to download the Spotify music first and then transfer the downloaded Spotify music to VLC for playback. However, in view of Spotify DRM protection, not all music downloaders can successfully get their needed Spotify music downloaded. **Now the following part just shows a professional Spotify to VLC downloader called Allavsoft to help users to easily download the Spotify music to VLC supported MP3, FLAC, etc.**
